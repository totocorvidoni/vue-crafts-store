# Crafts Store

Made for an artisan who sells her crochet creations. You can check out her site [here](https://tomascorridoni.com/pupe-lepu/).

It aims to focus on a narrow set of products to let visitors appreciate how much detail and love is put on every creation while at the same time giving a more personal feel than a regular e-shop.

I have set up a Wordpress installation with WooCommerce for the client to manage her products. The information is then requested by API calls from the front end app made with Vue.js.
